*In times past one pharaoh had 27 men two overtake 28.*

*When the pharaoh finally brought all together, they became a kingdom of 52.*

*Will you have what it takes to bring down a faro of his caliber once and for all?*

btw:
Anything that is *italicized* counts as a hint!
This is an OSINT based challenge
